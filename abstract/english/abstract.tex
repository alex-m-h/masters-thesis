We investigate the magnetostatic problem on exterior domains 
which are the complement of a compact set. In the first part, we prove 
the existence and uniqueness of a solution of the magnetostatic problem posed on the
complement of a toroidal domain with an additional curve integral constraint 
under suitable assumptions.
In the second part, we focus on the numerical approximation of solutions 
of the 2D magnetostatic problem
on an 
annulus domain involving a curve integral constraint where we investigate 
the idea to substitute this constraint using integration by parts and including it directly 
in the variational formulation. We prove well-posedness and an a-priori estimate 
of this formulation
and present numerical examples in the end that confirm our theoretical 
predictions.
